# CALORISTICS 
### PROG 01: Crunch Time

The purpose of the Caloristics Android application is to give users quick information about how many calories they have burned from doing their favorite exercises. 

Depending on the exercise, users can enter in either the number of minutes they have spent or the amount of repetitions performed on an exercise to see how many calories they have burned. They will also see a comparison to other exercises, so that they know how much work they would have had to do in order to burn that many calories doing another activity.
